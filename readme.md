# finally!! I can use threads
last C project yay, no more norm after this!!!!

I tried making fork taking and thread/processing as pluggable as possible.
That way I can easily make all three programs from the subject without changing too much.



## TODO
 - [ ] Fork taking
 - [ ] Give every philosopher a starvation checker thread*
 - [ ] Remove printf statement in logger.c
 - [ ] Dynamic sleep settings
 - [ ] Make all three programs

\* Starvation checker thread sets the death state and prints if starved

## Before turnin
 - [ ] Add error flags
 - [ ] Check norm
 - [ ] Check subject
 - [ ] Check leaks
